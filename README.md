# Supervised Learning: SVM, Decision Tree & AdaBoost - Finding Donors for CharityML

In this project, the performance of the above supervised algorithms are tested to accurately model an individuals' income using the data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then, the best candidate algorithm is chosen from preliminary results and further optimized to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, this value can be inferred from other publicly available features.

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.
